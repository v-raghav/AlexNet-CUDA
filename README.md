# AlexNet-CUDA

In this project, the convolutional layers of the famed AlexNet are implemented on a GPU by exploiting
the innate parallel nature of the computations. The objective is to create a GPU kernel for Convolution
(Cross-Correlation) operation, and then perform successive optimizations and evaluate the performance
obtained against a naive CPU implementation.
